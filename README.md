![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-portfolio-lightgrey)

A deterministic data pipeline that converts raw multimodal robot logs
(video + sensor streams) into aligned, validated datasets and metadata
for machine learning training and evaluation pipelines.

This project builds aligned, versioned robotics datasets from raw robot video and sensor logs. The pipeline performs ingestion, cross-modal alignment, episode extraction, dataset validation, and health analysis to simulate the core data infrastructure used in robotics ML systems.

## Example Dataset Outputs

Below are representative artifacts produced by the pipeline.

### Alignment health metrics

Derived dataset health signals produced during cross-modal alignment.

`derived/alignment_health.json`

```json
{
  "dt_abs_max": 0.0016666666666669272,
  "dt_abs_mean": 0.0010999999999999966,
  "dt_abs_p95": 0.0016666666666669272,
  "matched_count": 100,
  "matched_ratio": 1.0,
  "max_consecutive_missing": 0,
  "missing_by_reason": {},
  "missing_count": 0,
  "missing_ratio": 0.0,
  "total_frames": 100
}
```

### Extracted trajectory episodes

Continuous sequences of aligned frames used for downstream training.

`derived/episodes.json`

```json
{
  "episode_count": 1,
  "episodes": [
    {
      "episode_id": 0,
      "start_frame_idx": 0,
      "end_frame_idx": 99,
      "length": 100,
      "start_t": 0.0,
      "end_t": 3.3
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "episode_count": 1,
    "total_frames_in_episodes": 100,
    "max_length": 100,
    "mean_length": 100.0,
    "min_length": 100
  }
}
```

### From Episodes to Training Data

The pipeline outputs trajectory episodes, which represent continuous aligned segments of multimodal robot data. These segments identify portions of the dataset where video frames and sensor streams remain consistently synchronized.

A downstream training pipeline can use `episodes.json` to gather the corresponding video frames and sensor measurements for each episode and convert them into sliding windows used as training samples in downstream ML pipelines.

```text
Raw robot logs
(video + IMU)
        │
        ▼
Cross-modal alignment
        │
        ▼
alignment_map.jsonl
(frame ↔ sensor mapping)
        │
        ▼
Episode extraction
        │
        ▼
episodes.json
(continuous trajectory segments)
        │
        ▼
Training data loader
(windowed frame + sensor sequences)
        │
        ▼
Model training
```

In practice, the training loader reads the episode boundaries, collects the corresponding frames and sensor values, and converts each trajectory segment into training batches used by the model.

### Alignment artifact fingerprint

Content hash manifest ensuring reproducible dataset artifacts.

## Getting Started

The following steps demonstrate how to run the data engine on a sample session.

Example assets in `examples/` are small synthetic files used for demonstration.
The pipeline itself is designed to operate on real robotics datasets containing
video and multi-sensor logs.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philzd/robotics-data-engine.git
cd robotics_data_engine
```

2. Create a Python environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run a demo session:

```bash
python -m robotics_data_engine ingest \
  --session demo \
  --video examples/dummy_video.mp4 \
  --sensor examples/dummy_imu.csv

python -m robotics_data_engine align --session demo
```

4. Inspect dataset health:
   
```bash
python -m robotics_data_engine dataset-summary
```

This will produce alignment artifacts, episode segmentation results, and dataset health metrics for the session.

## Why This Project Exists

Modern robotics and embodied AI systems rely on large multimodal datasets containing:

- video
- IMU
- LiDAR
- robot state
- control signals

However, raw robot logs are often:

- temporally misaligned
- incomplete
- inconsistent across sensors
- difficult to reproduce or validate

This project demonstrates a deterministic data engine that:

- canonicalizes timestamps
- aligns multimodal signals
- validates dataset integrity
- extracts training episodes
- produces dataset health metrics

The system is designed to mirror the structure of real-world robotics ML data platforms.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Ingestion

Raw logs are copied into immutable session directories for deterministic processing.

Artifacts produced:

- `video_timestamps.jsonl`
- `sensor_normalized.csv`
- `qa_report.json`
- `session_manifest.json`

Video timestamps follow the deterministic rule:
`t_frame = frame_idx / fps`

### 2. Cross-Modal Alignment

Sensor timestamps are aligned to the video frame time base using nearest-neighbor matching.

Artifacts produced:

- `alignment_map.jsonl`
- `alignment_report.json`
- `alignment_examples.json`
- `alignment_invariants.json`
- `alignment_health.json`
- `alignment_warnings.json`
- `alignment_fingerprint.json`

Alignment explicitly records the time delta between modalities.
`dt = t_sensor - t_frame`

No hidden interpolation occurs to avoid introducing artificial
sensor values that could bias downstream model training.

### 3. Episode Extraction

Continuous sequences of successfully aligned frames are extracted into trajectory episodes.

Artifacts produced:

- `episodes.json`
- `episode_invariants.json`
- `episode_health.json`

Episodes represent training-ready trajectory segments.

### 4. Dataset Validation

Structural invariants verify that dataset artifacts satisfy expected schema and alignment contracts. Validation is applied after alignment and episode extraction artifacts are produced.

Examples:

- frame index continuity
- alignment threshold guarantees
- episode structure correctness

### 5. Dataset Health Metrics

The pipeline computes signals describing dataset quality:

Examples:

- matched frame ratio
- missing data ratio
- alignment error statistics
- trajectory fragmentation
- episode length statistics

These metrics enable quick evaluation of dataset quality.

### 6. Artifact Fingerprinting

Derived artifacts are hashed to produce a deterministic fingerprint.

The fingerprint hashes all derived artifacts using SHA-256 to ensure
that dataset outputs are content-addressable and reproducible.

This ensures:

- dataset reproducibility
- artifact provenance
- version traceability

## CLI Commands

The CLI provides commands for ingesting raw sessions, aligning multimodal data,
validating dataset artifacts, and inspecting dataset health. Commands can be
run individually depending on the workflow.

### Ingest a session

Copies raw inputs into a session and prepares normalized artifacts.

```bash
python -m robotics_data_engine ingest \
    --session demo_session \
    --video examples/dummy_video.mp4 \
    --sensor examples/dummy_imu.csv
```

### Align multimodal data

Performs cross-modal alignment and generates alignment artifacts, health metrics, and validation signals.

```bash
python -m robotics_data_engine align --session demo_session
```

### Validate dataset integrity

Runs invariant checks over alignment and episode artifacts.

```bash
python -m robotics_data_engine validate --session demo_session
```

### Process all sessions

Runs alignment across all sessions in the sessions directory.

```bash
python -m robotics_data_engine align-all
```

### Dataset summary

Aggregates dataset health metrics across sessions.

Summarize dataset health across sessions:

```bash
python -m robotics_data_engine dataset-summary
```

Example CLI output:

## Core Guarantees

robotics_data_engine enforces three core guarantees.

- **Determinism**:
  Given identical inputs and configuration, derived artifacts are identical.

- **Reproducibility**:
  Datasets can be rebuilt from raw data and manifest metadata.

- **Provenance**:
  Every artifact records its origin, configuration, and creation time.

These guarantees are enforced through:

- immutable session identity
- content hashing
- explicit manifests
- rebuildable derived artifacts

---

## Data Guarantees

robotics_data_engine enforces several guarantees over constructed datasets.

- **Deterministic dataset construction**:
  Given identical raw inputs and configuration, the pipeline produces identical derived artifacts.
  Mechanism: canonical timestamp extraction, deterministic alignment logic, and immutable session artifacts.

- **Explicit alignment semantics**:
  Cross-modal alignment always records the exact time delta between modalities. No hidden interpolation is performed.
  Mechanism: canonical timestamp extraction, deterministic alignment logic, and immutable session artifacts.

- **Invariant-validated datasets**:
  Alignment and episode artifacts are validated using structural invariants to detect corruption or schema violations.
  Mechanism: invariant checks applied to alignment and episode artifacts.

- **Observable dataset health**:
  The system computes dataset health metrics (alignment error, missing data ratio, episode fragmentation) to make dataset quality measurable.
  Mechanism: automated dataset health metrics generated during pipeline execution.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Typer (CLI framework)
- JSON / CSV artifact pipelines
- SHA-256 artifact fingerprinting

## Extensions: Dataset Layer and Inspection Tooling

The data engine can be extended beyond artifact generation into a
structured dataset layer and human-in-the-loop curation workflows.

### Parquet Dataset Layer

Derived artifacts are materialized into partitioned Parquet datasets to support efficient querying and downstream ML workflows.

```text
datasets/
  frames/         # Frame-level aligned data
  episodes/       # Trajectory segments
  session_health/ # Dataset quality metrics
```

These datasets provide a structured interface for analytics, training pipelines, and evaluation systems.

### Inspection Tooling

A lightweight CLI-based inspection tool enables exploration of trajectory episodes and dataset quality signals.

Example:

```bash
python src/scripts/inspect_episodes.py \
  --session demo_session \
  --show-health
```

Example output:

```text
=== Session Health ===

session=demo_session | missing_ratio=0.000 | p95=0.0017 | fragmentation=0.000 | status=OK
```

### Labeling Workflow

A simple labeling system supports human-in-the-loop dataset curation.

Labels and review status are manually assigned by the user during inspection and are not automatically generated by the pipeline.

Users can attach:

- labels (e.g., `good`, `bad_alignment`, `missing_data`)
- review status (`reviewed`, `needs_review`)
- notes for debugging or annotation

Example:

```bash
python src/scripts/label_episode.py \
  --session demo_session \
  --episode-id 0 \
  --label bad_alignment \
  --review-status needs_review \
  --notes "drift detected"
```

Stored labels:

```json
[
  {
    "session_id": "demo_session",
    "episode_id": 0,
    "label": "bad_alignment",
    "review_status": "needs_review",
    "notes": "drift detected"
  }
]
```

### End-to-End Workflow

```text
Parquet dataset → inspection → labeling → curated dataset
```

This models how real-world robotics and ML systems incorporate
human review into dataset development pipelines.
